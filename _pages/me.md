I am a beginner in the field of Information Technology with an educational background as a graduate in Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak (RPL). Although I am just starting my career journey in the technology world, my strong enthusiasm is to understand and develop my skills in programming and cybersecurity.

As a graduate in Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak (RPL), I have acquired a solid knowledge base in software development and programming.

Furthermore, my specific interest lies in the field of cybersecurity. Despite being in the early stages, I am currently learning to grasp the basic concepts of cybersecurity, including threat detection and effective security practices. I am aware of the crucial importance of security in today's digital age and am committed to continuously learning and growing in this field.

I am an enthusiastic, diligent individual ready to learn from every experience. Despite being a beginner, I believe that with dedication and a high learning spirit, I can build a strong foundation to thrive in the realms of programming and cybersecurity.
